# cc-R-RStudio

This workshop will will provide a hands-on introduction to the R analytic programming language and the RStudio Integrated Development Environment (IDE) within which R analyses can be written. R is an open source language that runs in the Windows, Mac, and Linux operating systems and provvices a set of tools that enable a wide range of data analyses. This workshop will give you a start down the road towards using R in your work. To participate in the workshop (which we strongly recommend) you will need to install the R programming language (available for free download from here: https://cran.r-project.org) and the free RStudio Desktop open source IDE (https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/). You should install R first, then RStudio. 

Launch the workshop in RStudio Cloud for the hosted (account required) RStudio environment:
